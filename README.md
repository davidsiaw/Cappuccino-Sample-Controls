Cappuccino Demos
---

I am a big fan of working demos. They give a sense of functionality and act as a great way for newcomers to experiment and evaluate.

This is forked from an old repository someone else left behind that I found extremely useful, albeit not very searchable. 

The code can be a valuable cut & paste resource to quickly whip up apps.

Enjoy
